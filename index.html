            BRIEF ABOUT WEB-DEVELOPMENT
        </h1>

        <img src="web/coding.webp" alt="">

        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications, involving a combination
        of programming, design, and various technologies. It encompasses everything from creating simple static web
        pages to complex dynamic web applications. The key components of web development include:

        <h2>
            1. Client-Side (Front-end) Development:
        </h2>

        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Defines the structure and content of web pages.
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles the presentation and layout of HTML elements.
        JavaScript: Enables dynamic and interactive features on the client side, allowing for user interactions and
        real-time updates.
        Server-Side (Back-end) Development:

        <h2>
            2. Server:
        </h2>
        Manages requests from clients, processes data, and sends responses.
        Back-end Programming Languages: Such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or Node.js, handle server-side logic and
        database interactions.
        Database Management Systems (DBMS): Like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, store and retrieve data.

        <h2>
            3. Full-Stack Development:
        </h2>

        Involves proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, allowing developers to work on all aspects of a
        web application.
        <h2>
            4. Web Development Frameworks and Libraries:
        </h2>


    </div>
    <div class="container" id="b">
        <h2>
            Front-end Frameworks:
        </h2>
        <img src="web/frontend.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js, provide pre-built components and tools for efficient
            development.
        <h2>
            Back-end Frameworks:
        </h2>
        <img src="web/backend.webp" alt="">
        Such as Django (Python), Ruby on Rails, or Express.js (Node.js), streamline server-side
        development.
        </p>

        <h2>
            5. Web Architecture:
        </h2>

        <p>
            Client-Server Model: Separates the client (user interface) and server (data processing), enhancing
            scalability
            and maintenance.
            RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Enable communication between different parts of a web
            application, facilitating data exchange.
        </p>

        <h2>
            6. Web Development Tools:
        </h2>

        <p>
            Text Editors/IDEs: Like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text, for writing and editing code.
            Version Control Systems: Such as Git, help manage and track changes in code collaboratively.
            Package Managers: Like npm (Node Package Manager) or pip (Python Package Installer), simplify the process of
            installing and managing libraries.
        </p>

        <h2>
            7. Responsive Web Design:
        </h2>

            <img src="web/responsive.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
            Ensures that websites and applications function well on various devices and screen sizes.

        <h2>
            8. Web Security:
        </h2>

        Involves implementing measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
        and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
        Web development is a dynamic field, and developers continually adapt to new technologies and trends to create
        efficient, secure, and user-friendly web experiences.
